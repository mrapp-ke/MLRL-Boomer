# Quality-of-Life Improvements

- The build system now uses a lightweight custom implementation instead of [SCons](https://scons.org/) and is better modularized to avoid unnecessary runs of Continuous Integration jobs when only certain parts of it are modified.
- Releases are now automated via Continuous Integration, including the update of the project's changelog.
- The presentation of algorithmic parameters in the documentation has been improved.
- Outdated GitHub Actions can now be printed via the build target `check_github_actions`. Alternatively, the build target `update_github_actions` may be used to update them automatically.
- The build target `update_dependencies` can now be used to update Python dependencies. The build targets `update_build_dependencies` and `update_runtime_dependencies` only update build-time and runtime dependencies, respectively.
- Continuous Integration is now used to automatically update outdated GitHub Actions on a regular schedule.
- Continuous Integration is now used to automatically update outdated Python dependencies on a regular basis.
- Continuous Integration is now used to periodically update the Doxygen configuration file used for generating API documentations for C++ code.
- The syntax of TOML files is now validated by applying [taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) via Continuous Integration.
