# Quality-of-Life Improvements

- The build system now uses a lightweight custom implementation instead of [SCons](https://scons.org/) and is better modularized to avoid unnecessary runs of Continuous Integration jobs when only certain parts of it are modified.
- Releases are now automated via Continuous Integration, including the update of the project's changelog.
- The presentation of algorithmic parameters in the documentation has been improved.
- Outdated GitHub Actions can now be printed via the build target `check_github_actions`. Alternatively, the build target `update_github_actions` may be used to update them automatically.
