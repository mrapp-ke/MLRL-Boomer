# Fixes

- Fixed faulty calculation of gradients and Hessians when using the BOOMER regression algorithm with the command line arguments `--loss squared-error-non-decomposable` and `--head-type single`.

# Quality-of-Life Improvements

- Linux ARM64 packages are now build natively instead of using virtualization, which speeds up the build process tremendously.
- Continuous Integration is now used to automatically update the versions of GitHub runners on a regular basis.
