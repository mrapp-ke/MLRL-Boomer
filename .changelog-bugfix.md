# Fixes

- When building macOS packages, we do now manually compile OpenMP to ensure that the bundled library matches the target platform.

# Quality-of-Life Improvements

- The build system now uses a lightweight custom implementation instead of [SCons](https://scons.org/) and is better modularized to avoid unnecessary runs of Continuous Integration jobs when only certain parts of it are modified.
- Releases are now automated via Continuous Integration, including the update of the project's changelog.
- The presentation of algorithmic parameters in the documentation has been improved.
- Continuous Integration is now used to automatically update outdated GitHub Actions, outdated Python dependencies, and the Doxygen configuration on a regular basis.
- Continuous Integration is now used to check the documentation for broken links and spelling mistakes.
- The syntax of TOML files is now validated by applying [taplo](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo) via Continuous Integration.
