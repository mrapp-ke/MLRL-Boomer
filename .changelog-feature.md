# API Changes

- The options `min_samples` and `max_samples` have been added to the values of the command line arguments `--feature-sampling` and `--instance-sampling`.
- The indices of nominal and ordinal features must now be provided to a learner's `fit`-method via the keyword arguments `nominal_feature_indices` and `ordinal_feature_indices`.
- The Python API does now allow to provide custom weights for training examples to a learner's `fit`-method via the keyword argument `sample_weights`. 

# Algorithmic Enhancements
- The BOOMER algorithm can now be configured to use either 32- or 64-bit floating point values for representing gradients. Using lower-precision values might speed up training at the risk of losing training accuracy.
- Unnecessary conversions from integer weights to floating point values are now avoided.

# Quality-of-Life Improvements

- C++ 20 is now required for compiling the project.
