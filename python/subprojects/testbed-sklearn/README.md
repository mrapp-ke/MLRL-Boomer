This software package is an extension to the package [mlrl-testbed](https://pypi.org/project/mlrl-testbed/) which provides a command line utility for running machine learning experiments. It adds support for experiments that involve training and evaluating a machine learning algorithm using the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) framework. For further information on the command line utility, refer to its [documentation](https://mlrl-boomer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/testbed/index.html).
