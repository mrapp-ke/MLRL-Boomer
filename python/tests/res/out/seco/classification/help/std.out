                        Whether the characteristics of binary predictions
                        should be written into output files or not. Does only
                        have an effect if the argument --prediction-type is
                        set to binary and if the argument --output-dir is
                        specified. Must be one of {"false", "true"}. For
                        additional options refer to the documentation.
  --store-predictions STORE_PREDICTIONS
                        Whether predictions should be written into output
                        files or not. Does only have an effect, if the
                        argument --output-dir is specified. Must be one of

                        text file or not. Must be one of {"false", "true"}.
                        For additional options refer to the documentation.
  --time-limit TIME_LIMIT
                        The duration in seconds after which the induction of
                        rules should be canceled. Must be at least 1 or 0, if
                        no time limit should be set
  --wipe-output-dir WIPE_OUTPUT_DIR
                        Whether all files in the directory specified via the
                        argument --output-dir should be deleted before an
