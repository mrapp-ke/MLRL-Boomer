# Overview of Parameters

The behavior of the BOOMER algorithm can be controlled in a fine-grained manner via a large number of parameters. Values for these parameters may be provided as constructor arguments to the class {py:class}`mlrl.boosting.BoomerClassifier <mlrl.boosting.learners.BoomerClassifier>` or {py:class}`mlrl.boosting.BoomerRegressor <mlrl.boosting.learners.BoomerRegressor>` as shown in the section {ref}`usage`. They can also be used to configure the algorithm when using the {ref}`command line API<testbed>` provided by the package [mlrl-testbed](https://pypi.org/project/mlrl-testbed/).

All parameters mentioned below are optional. If not specified manually, default settings that work well in most of the cases are used. In the following, an overview of all available parameters, as well as their default values, is provided. Unless stated otherwise, all parameters can be used for both, classification and regression problems.

  : `'true'`, if a model for the calibration of probabilities should be used, if available, `'false'` otherwise. Does only have an effect if the option `based_on_probabilities` is set to the value `'true'`.

`'example-wise'`

: The label vector that is predicted for an example is chosen from the set of label vectors encountered in the training data. The following options may be provided using the {ref}`bracket notation<bracket-notation>`:

  `based_on_probabilities` *(Default value = `'false'`)*
  : `'true'`, if binary predictions should be derived from probability estimates rather than scores if supported by the loss function, `'false'` otherwise.

  `use_probability_calibration` *(Default value = `'true'`)*
  : `'true'`, if a model for the calibration of probabilities should be used, if available, `'false'` otherwise. Does only have an effect if the option `based_on_probabilities` is set to the value `'true'`.

`'gfm'`

: The label vector that is predicted for an example is chosen according to the general F-measure maximizer (GFM).

  `use_probability_calibration` *(Default value = `'true'`)*
  : `'true'`, if a model for the calibration of probabilities should be used, if available, `'false'` otherwise.

### `probability_predictor`

> *Default value = `'auto'`. Can only be used in classification problems.*

`'auto'`

: The most suitable strategy for predicting probability estimates is chosen automatically, depending on the loss function.

`'output-wise'`

: The prediction for an example is determined for each label independently

  `use_probability_calibration` *(Default value = `'true'`)*
  : `'true'`, if a model for the calibration of probabilities should be used, if available, `'false'` otherwise.

`'marginalized'`

: The prediction for an example is determined via marginalization over the set of label vectors encountered in the training data.

  `use_probability_calibration` *(Default value = `'true'`)*
  : `'true'`, if a model for the calibration of probabilities should be used, if available, `'false'` otherwise.

## Multi-Threading

The following parameters allow to specify whether multi-threading should be used for different aspects of the algorithm. Depending on your hardware, they may help to reduce the time needed for training or prediction.

```{important}
To be able to use the algorithm's multi-threading capabilities, it must have been compiled with multi-threading support enabled, which should be the case with pre-built packages available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Please refer to the section {ref}`build-options` if you intend to compile the program yourself, or if you want to check if multi-threading support is enabled for your installation.
```

### `parallel_rule_refinement`

> *Default value = `'auto'`.*

`'auto'`

: The number of threads to be used to search for potential refinements of rules in parallel is chosen automatically, depending on the loss function.

`'false'`

: No multi-threading is used to search for potential refinements of rules.

`'true'`

: Multi-threading is used to search for potential refinements of rules in parallel. The following options may be provided using the {ref}`bracket notation<bracket-notation>`:

  `num_preferred_threads` *(Default value = `0`)*
  : The number of preferred threads. The given value must be at least 1 or 0, if the number of cores available on the machine should be used. If not enough CPU cores are available or if multi-threading support is disabled, as many threads as possible are used.

### `parallel_statistic_update`

> *Default value = `'auto'`.*

`'auto'`

: The number of threads to be used to calculate the gradients and Hessians for different examples in parallel is chosen automatically, depending on the loss function.

`'false'`

: No multi-threading is used to calculate the gradients and Hessians of different examples.

`'true'`

: Multi-threading is used to calculate the gradients and Hessians of different examples in parallel. The following options may be provided using the {ref}`bracket notation<bracket-notation>`:

  `num_preferred_threads` *(Default value = `0`)*
  : The number of preferred threads. The given value must be at least 1 or 0, if the number of cores available on the machine should be used. If not enough CPU cores are available or if multi-threading support is disabled, as many threads as possible are used.

### `parallel_prediction`

> *Default value = `'true'`.*

`'false'`

: No multi-threading is used to obtain predictions for different examples.

`'true'`

: Multi-threading is used to obtain predictions for different examples in parallel. The following options may be provided using the {ref}`bracket notation<bracket-notation>`:

  `num_preferred_threads` *(Default value = `0`)*
  : The number of preferred threads. The given value must be at least 1 or 0, if the number of cores available on the machine should be used. If not enough CPU cores are available or if multi-threading support is disabled, as many threads as possible are used.
