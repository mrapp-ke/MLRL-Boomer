Parameters
----------

The behavior of the BOOMER algorithm can be controlled in a fine-grained manner via a large number of parameters. Values for these parameters may be provided as constructor arguments to the class ``Boomer`` as shown in the section :ref:`usage`. They can also be used to configure the algorithm when using the :ref:`testbed`.

All of the parameters that are mentioned below are optional. If not specified manually, default settings that work well in most of the cases are used. In the following, an overview of all available parameters, as well as their default values, is provided.

.. note::
    Each parameter is identified by an unique name. Depending on the type of a parameter, it either accepts numbers as possible values or allows to specify a string that corresponds to a predefined set of possible values (boolean values are also represented as strings).

    In addition to the specified value, some parameters allow to provide additional options as key-value pairs. These options must be provided by using the following bracket notation:

    ``'value{key1=value1,key2=value2}'``

    For example, the parameter ``feature_binning`` allows to provide additional options and may be configured as follows:

    ``'equal-width{bin_ratio=0.33,min_bins=2,max_bins=64}'``

**Data Format**

The following parameters allow to specify the preferred format for the representation of the training data:

* ``feature_format`` (Default value = ``'auto'``)

  * ``'auto'`` The most suitable format for representation of the feature matrix is chosen automatically by estimating which representation requires less memory.
  * ``'dense'`` Enforces that the feature matrix is stored using a dense format.
  * ``'sparse'`` Enforces that the feature matrix is stored using a sparse format. Using a sparse format may reduce the memory footprint and/or speed up the training process on some data sets.

* ``label_format`` (Default value = ``'auto'``)

  * ``'auto'`` The most suitable format for representation of the label matrix is chosen automatically by estimating which representation requires less memory.
  * ``'dense'`` Enforces that the label matrix is stored using a dense format.
  * ``'sparse'`` Enforces that the label matrix is stored using a sparse format. Using a sparse format may reduce the memory footprint on some data sets.

  * ``'auto'`` The most suitable format for representation of predicted labels is chosen automatically based on the sparsity of the ground truth labels supplied for training.
  * ``'dense'`` Enforces that predicted labels are stored using a dense format.
