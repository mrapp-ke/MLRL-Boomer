Installation
------------

The BOOMER algorithm is provided as part of the Python package `mlrl-boomer <https://pypi.org/project/mlrl-boomer/>`__. It can be installed via `pip <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pip_(package_manager)>`_:

.. code-block:: text

   pip install mlrl-boomer

.. note::
    Currently, the above package is only available for x86_64 Linux platforms. Support for Windows and MacOS systems is planned for future releases.

An example of how to use the algorithm in your own Python program can be found in the section :ref:`usage` below.

In addition, the package `mlrl-testbed <https://pypi.org/project/mlrl-testbed/>`__ can optionally be installed via the following command:

.. code-block:: text

   pip install mlrl-testbed

The above package comes with a command line API that allows to configure the BOOMER algorithm and apply it to a given dataset without the need to write code. For more information, refer to the section :ref:`testbed`.
