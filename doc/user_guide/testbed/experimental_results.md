# Output of Experimental Results

One of the most important features provided by the command line API is the ability to output a wide variety of experimental results that provide valuable insights into the models learned by a machine learning algorithm, the predictions it provides, and the data it has been trained on.

Each of these information can either be printed to the console or saved to output files. The latter requires to provide a directory, where the output files should be saved. As shown in the examples below, the path to this directory must be specified via the argument `--output-dir`.

```{note}
The path of the directory, where experimental results should be saved, can be either absolute or relative to the working directory.
```
