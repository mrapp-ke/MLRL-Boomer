In this section, we provide a detailed discussion of the methodology, the BOOMER algorithm is based on. To achieve optimal results and depending on the use case at hand, it may be beneficial to use a custom configuration for certain aspects of the algorithm. Following up on the introduction in the section {ref}`usage`, the goal of this section is to highlight these aspects and provide an overview of the available configuration options:
