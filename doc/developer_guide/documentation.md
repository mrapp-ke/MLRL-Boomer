# Generating the Documentation

The documentation of the BOOMER algorithm and other software provided by this project is publicly available at [https://mlrl-boomer.readthedocs.io](https://mlrl-boomer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This website should be the primary source of information for everyone who wants to learn about our work. However, if you want to generate the documentation from scratch, e.g., for offline use on your own computer, follow the instructions below.

```{tip}
The documentation is regularly built by our {ref}`ci` jobs. The documentation generated by a particular job is saved as an [artifact](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts) and can be downloaded as a zip archive.
```

## Prerequisites

In order to generate the documentation, [Doxygen](https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/) must be installed on the host system beforehand. It is used to generate an API documentation from the C++ source files. In addition, the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font should be available on your system. If this is not the case, another font will be used as a fallback.

`````{tip}
It is not necessary to execute the steps below one after the other. Instead, running the following command should suffice to create the entire documentation, including files that describe the C++ and Python API.

````{tab} Linux
   ```text
   ./build doc
   ```
````

````{tab} MacOS
   ```text
   ./build doc
   ```
````

````{tab} Windows
   ```text
   build.bat doc
   ```
````
`````

Whenever the documentation was updated or any C++ or Python source files have been modified, the above command must be run again in order to generate an updated version of the documentation that reflects the respective changes.

## Building the C++ Apidocs

By running the following command, the C++ API documentation is generated via Doxygen:

````{tab} Linux
   ```text
   ./build apidoc_cpp
   ```
````

````{tab} MacOS
   ```text
   ./build apidoc_cpp
   ```
````

````{tab} Windows
   ```text
   build.bat apidoc_cpp
   ```
````

The resulting HTML files should be located in the directory `doc/apidoc/api/cpp/`.

## Building the Python Apidocs

Similarly, the following command generates an API documentation from the project's Python code via [sphinx-apidoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-apidoc.html):

````{tab} Linux
   ```text
   ./build apidoc_python
   ```
````

````{tab} MacOS
   ```text
   ./build apidoc_python
   ```
````

````{tab} Windows
   ```text
   build.bat apidoc_python
   ```
````

```{note}
If you want to generate the API documentation for the C++ and Python code simulatenously, it is possible to use the build target `apidoc` instead of `apidoc_cpp` and `apidoc_python`.
```

## Building the Final Documentation

To generate the final documentation's HTML files via [sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), the following command can be used:

````{tab} Linux
   ```text
   ./build doc
   ```
````

````{tab} MacOS
   ```text
   ./build doc
   ```
````

````{tab} Windows
   ```text
   build.bat doc
   ```
````

Afterwards, the generated files can be found in the directory `doc/build_/`.

## Cleaning up Build Files

Files that have been generated via the above steps can be removed by invoking the respective commands with the command line argument `--clean`. A more detailed description of how to use this command line argument can be found under {ref}`compilation`.
