In the following, we provide an overview of scientific publications that are concerned with the BOOMER algorithm. In particular, this includes papers where different aspects of the algorithm's methodology have originally been proposed. They are the best source of information for those who are interested in how BOOMER works from a conceptual and mathematical point of view. In addition, we also refer to studies that have made use of the algorithm.
