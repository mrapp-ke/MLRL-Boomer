**pRSL: Interpretable Multi-label Stacking by Learning Probabilistic Rules**

The BOOMER algorithm was used as a baseline in the experimental study that is included in the following paper, where a probabilistic rule stacking learner, which uses probabilistic propositional logic rules and belief propagation, to combine the predictions of several classifiers is proposed. A preprint of the paper is available at `arxiv.org <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13850.pdf>`__.

**A Flexible Class of Dependence-aware Multi-label Loss Functions**

In the following paper, the predictive performance of the BOOMER algorithm in terms of a family of novel multi-label evaluation measures is compared experimentally to several competitors. A preprint of the paper is available at `arxiv.org <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00792.pdf>`__.

**Correlation-based Discovery of Disease Patterns for Syndromic Surveillance**

In the following paper, a novel rule learning approach for discovering syndrome definitions for the early detection of infectious diseases is presented. The implementation of the proposed method, which is available at `Github <https://github.com/mrapp-ke/SyndromeLearner>`__, is based on this project's source code. A preprint of the paper is available at `arxiv.org <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.09208.pdf>`__.
