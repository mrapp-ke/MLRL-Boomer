This is a research project evolving around the machine learning algorithm {ref}`BOOMER <user-guide-boomer>` â€“ An algorithm for learning ensembles of gradient boosted multi-output rules that integrates with the popular [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) machine learning framework. It is aimed at multi-output problems, including [multi-label classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-label_classification) and [multi-output regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis).

The BOOMER algorithm is build upon a modular framework for implementing rule learning algorithms. This enables to implement different kinds of algorithms more easily. One example is the multi-label {ref}`SeCo algorithm <user-guide-seco>` provided by this project. It is based on traditional rule learning techniques and is particularly well-suited for learning interpretable models. Additional algorithms may follow in the future. The same applies to tools and utilities evolving around these algorithms.
