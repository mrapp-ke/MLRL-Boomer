Defines targets and modules for compiling native library dependencies on macOS. This is necessary when building
pre-built packages via "cibuildwheel", because the de facto package manager "homebrew" will install libraries that are
compiled for the specific macOS version the build machine is running, instead of using the proper version for the target
platform (see https://cibuildwheel.pypa.io/en/stable/faq/#missing-dependencies).
