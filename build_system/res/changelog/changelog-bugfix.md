# Fixes

- Fixed an issue that prevented multi-threading from being used by the BOOMER algorithm for updating statistics.
- Fixed an ImportError when using the package "mlrl-testbed" without "mlrl-testbed-slurm" being installed.
- When passing the `--version` or `-v` flag to the command line API, the output is now properly formatted again.
